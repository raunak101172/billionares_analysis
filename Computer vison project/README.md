# Image Classification Model

This project is a binary image classification model to predict whether diabetic retionpathy is referenceable or not. 

I have trained a neural network with tensorflow and keras to classify the images into the two categories (referenceable or non-referenceable).

This model gives an accuracy of 80%

The dataset was much too large to be uploaded here but below are some screenshots of images in both the categories. There is also a screenshot of the preliminary code I used to segregate the original dataset file into training and test data.
