# Encryption Decryption Program

This code is a Python program that uses the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a basic encryption and decryption tool. The program imports the messagebox, simpledialog, and Tk modules from Tkinter.

The main functionalities of the code are as follows:

1.It defines functions to check if a number is even, extract even and odd letters from a message, and swap the positions of even and odd letters in a message.

2.The program prompts the user to choose between encryption and decryption and enter a secret message.

3.If encryption is selected, the program encrypts the message by swapping the positions of even and odd letters and displays the encrypted result in a message box.

4.If decryption is chosen, the program decrypts the message using the same swapping technique and shows the decrypted result in a message box.

The program continues to prompt the user for tasks until an option other than encryption or decryption is chosen, at which point it exits.
Overall, this code provides a simple and user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting messages.
