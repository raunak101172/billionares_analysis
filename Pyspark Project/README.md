# Sentiment Analysis Project with Pyspark

This project uses Pyspark to create a sentiment analysis model for twitter tweets. 

First the tweets were cleaned used various data cleaning and preparation methods as seen in the cleandata.ipynb file. Then the cleaned tweets are collected into another csv file and used to train the model.

The model comes out with an accuracy of about 79%

Unfortunately the dataset is too large to be uploaded to GitHub but this inside the cleandata.ipynb file you will find snippets of the dataset .
